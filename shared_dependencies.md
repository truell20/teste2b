The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so React is a shared dependency across all the files. It is used to create components and manage the application's state.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used in all the files for type checking and improved developer experience. It is used to define the types of variables, function parameters, and return values.

4. **React-DOM**: This is used in all the files to render React components to the DOM.

5. **Document**: This is a Next.js specific component that is used to augment the application's HTML structure. It is used in the `_document.tsx` file.

6. **App**: This is another Next.js specific component that is used to initialize pages. It is used in the `_app.tsx` file.

7. **CSS**: The `globals.css` file contains global styles that are shared across all the pages of the application.

8. **Public Assets**: The `favicon.ico` and `vercel.svg` files in the public directory are assets that can be used across the application.

9. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of dependencies and scripts for the application. It is shared across all the files as it determines the packages that are available for use in the application.

10. **tsconfig.json**: This file contains the configuration for TypeScript. It is shared across all the files as it determines the rules for TypeScript compilation.
